--   the consumer is concurrently consuming.

-- | Concurrently join the producer and consumer, using a bounded queue of the
--   given size.  The producer will block when the queue is full, if it is
--   producing faster than the consumers is taking from it.  Likewise, if the
--   consumer races ahead, it will block until more input is available.
--
--   Exceptions are properly managed and propagated between the two sides, so
--   the net effect should be equivalent to not using buffer at all, save for
--   the concurrent interleaving of effects.

-- | An operator form of 'buffer'.  In general you should be able to replace

-- | Gather output values asynchronously from an action in the base monad and

--   function called from a C library.
