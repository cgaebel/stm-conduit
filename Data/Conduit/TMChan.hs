-- | * Introduction
--
--   Contains a simple source and sink for linking together conduits in
--   in different threads. Usage is so easy, it's best explained with an
--   example:
--
--   We first create a channel for communication...
--
--   > do chan <- atomically $ newTBMChan 16
--
--   Then we fork a new thread loading a wackton of pictures into memory. The
--   data (pictures, in this case) will be streamed down the channel to whatever
--   is on the other side.
--
--   >    _ <- forkIO . runResourceT $ loadTextures lotsOfPictures $$ sinkTBMChan chan
--
--   Finally, we connect something to the other end of the channel. In this
--   case, we connect a sink which uploads the textures one by one to the
--   graphics card.
--
--   >    runResourceT $ sourceTBMChan chan $$ Conduit.mapM_ (liftIO . uploadToGraphicsCard)
--
--   By running the two tasks in parallel, we no longer have to wait for one
--   texture to upload to the graphics card before reading the next one from
--   disk. This avoids the common switching of bottlenecks (such as between the
--   disk and graphics memory) that most loading processes seem to love.
--
--   Control.Concurrent.STM.TMChan and Control.Concurrent.STM.TBMChan are
--   re-exported for convenience.
--
--   * Caveats
--
--   It is recommended to use TBMChan as much as possible, and generally avoid
--   TMChan usage. TMChans are unbounded, and if used, the conduit pipeline
--   will no longer use a bounded amount of space. They will essentially leak
--   memory if the writer is faster than the reader.
--
--   Therefore, use bounded channels as much as possible, preferably with a
--   high bound so it will be hit infrequently.
