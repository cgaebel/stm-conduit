-- | Contains a simple source and sink linking together conduits in
--   different threads. For extended examples of usage and bottlenecks
--   see 'Data.Conduit.TMChan'.
--
--   TQueue is an amoritized FIFO queue behaves like TChan, with two
--   important differences:
--
--     * it's faster (but amortized thus the cost of individual operations
--     may vary a lot)
--
--     * it doesn't provide equivalent of the dupTChan and cloneTChan
--     operations
--
--
--   Here is short description of data structures:
--     
--     * TQueue   - unbounded infinite queue
--
--     * TBQueue  - bounded infinite queue
--
--     * TMQueue  - unbounded finite (closable) queue
--
--     * TBMQueue - bounded finite (closable) queue
--
-- Caveats
-- 
--   Infinite operations means that source doesn't know when stream is
--   ended so one need to use other methods of finishing stream like
--   sending an exception or finish conduit in downstream.
